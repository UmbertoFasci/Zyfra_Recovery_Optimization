# Zyfra - Optimizaing Gold Recovery

## Introduction

In the mining industry, extracting gold from ore is a complex process that requires multiple stages of purification and refinement. The efficiency of this process, measured by the recovery rate, is crucial for both economic and environmental reasons. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the recovery rate of gold during the purification process, using data collected from various stages of a gold recovery plant.

The dataset encompasses multiple parameters measured throughout the technological process, including concentrations of different metals (Au, Ag, Pb), particle sizes, and various other features recorded at different stages of purification. These measurements are time-stamped, creating a temporal dimension to our analysis that could reveal important patterns in the recovery process.

The primary objective is to create a model that can accurately predict the recovery rate of gold, which will help optimize the purification process and reduce production costs.

The project's success will be measured using the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE), providing a balanced assessment of our model's predictive capabilities.
